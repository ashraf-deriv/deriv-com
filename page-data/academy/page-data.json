At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Because of this weekly rise, June's deficit is now $373 billion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following its downward drop, the price of Bitcoin stabilised once again over the $20,000 mark. As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn. Furthermore, traders reduced their stakes in cryptocurrencies after the price of Bitcoin fell last week to its lowest level since 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, significant US economic metrics and central bank discussions might put traders' appetites to the test.

Despite last week's Federal Reserve announcement of a 0.75% rate hike &ndash; the most significant since 1994 &ndash; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the Fed is \"firmly committed\" to bringing inflation down.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, last week's economic data indicated that the Federal Reserve's aggressive move toward monetary tightening was having the desired effect of slowing the economy and moderating inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 11 of the benchmark index's sectors rallied.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022.

With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected. Additionally, Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown actions have outweighed stable fuel demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" alt=\"Ethereum chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Except for Cardano (ADA), which was up by 6% in the last 7 days, all top 10 cryptocurrencies have fallen by at least 3%. Altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) fell by around 6-10% for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market leader Bitcoin fared better than other coins, falling by only 3% in the past 7 days.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

So, traders may still be cautious since the sentiments of businesses can change very quickly.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of this week will be the highly-anticipated May update to the consumer inflation rate in the US, which could indicate whether inflation may have peaked.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></span></p>","main_image":{"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8d838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/02a23/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/476c5/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/e49a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/a7d58/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/467a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/f42d9/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/1e622/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":120}}},"description":"Weekly market report â€“ 06 Jun 2022","id":"ea31c1ed-ad3b-4093-b5b9-a4908c9a2b88"}},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","blog_title":"Weekly market report â€“ 30 May 2022","slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","tags":[{"tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, markets bounced back after several weeks of decline.

As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index.

On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD finished the week with solid gains just below the $1.06 mark. Although risk-aversion persists, the leading cause of this rally was the weakening US dollar. Moreover, recent inflation rates have doubled central banks' comfort levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor that may have contributed to the pair&rsquo;s rise is the European Central Bank. With an interest rate hike in July now being a possibility, several government council members have declared their willingness to increase interest rates as soon as possible. In fact, according to financial analysts, the odds of a 50 bps rise at the start of the third quarter have risen from 40% to 52%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week the GBP/USD pair crossed into positive territory for the first time in over a month, allowing traders to breathe a sigh of relief. As seen in the chart above, GBP/USD started the week around the $1.23 mark, dipped and recovered to end the week near $1.25.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the UK data releases are strong, they still shed light on the massive problem the Bank of England (BoE) faces over the next few months. Based on 9% inflation data, the BoE suggests the inflation rate may even reach double digits in the coming months before dropping in late 2022/2023. On the other hand, the US dollar failed to capitalise on the Fed's hawkish comments, and US Treasury yields rose, sending GBP/USD higher to test the $1.25 level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, USD/JPY attracted some dip-buying near the &yen;127.15 level, though a modest US dollar weakness kept further gains in check. Furthermore, a generally positive tone in the equity markets also weakened the safe-haven Japanese yen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

However, it gained an upward momentum due to declining US yields and the US dollar&rsquo;s demand being impacted by the disappointing earnings figures and bleak sales prospects from large retailers in the US. For the first time since mid-April, XAU/USD recorded weekly gains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, after the announcement of zero coronavirus infections across all districts in Shanghai, the yellow metal managed to rebound and enjoy temporary relief as its price increased to reach near the $1,830 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in the chart above, gold ended its week near $1,846, swaying upwards midweek and is currently above its moving average, which acts as its support level. The 5-day SMA and 10-day SMA are around $1,844 and $1,842, respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, oil prices comfortably remained within recent ranges and aren&rsquo;t trading with much conviction. A lack of new major crude oil-relevant fundamental developments in the last week may have resulted in the WTI moving in the $105-115ish ranges. Furthermore, the proposed EU ban on Russian oil imports still hasn&rsquo;t secured the unanimous agreement amongst EU member nations that needed to go into force.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong><br /><br /></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,261.90</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-961.52</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.98%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,835.62</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-407.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.33%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,901.36</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-106.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.66%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Markets continued to face downward pressure, with Wednesday, 18 May 2022, marking the biggest one-day decline in the S&amp;P 500 index since June 2020.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022.

With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected. Additionally, Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown actions have outweighed stable fuel demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" alt=\"Ethereum chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Except for Cardano (ADA), which was up by 6% in the last 7 days, all top 10 cryptocurrencies have fallen by at least 3%. Altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) fell by around 6-10% for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market leader Bitcoin fared better than other coins, falling by only 3% in the past 7 days.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

So, traders may still be cautious since the sentiments of businesses can change very quickly.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of this week will be the highly-anticipated May update to the consumer inflation rate in the US, which could indicate whether inflation may have peaked.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></span></p>","main_image":{"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8d838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/02a23/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/476c5/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/e49a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/a7d58/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/467a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/f42d9/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/1e622/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":120}}},"description":"Weekly market report â€“ 06 Jun 2022","id":"ea31c1ed-ad3b-4093-b5b9-a4908c9a2b88"}},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","blog_title":"Weekly market report â€“ 30 May 2022","slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","tags":[{"tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, markets bounced back after several weeks of decline.

As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index.

On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD finished the week with solid gains just below the $1.06 mark. Although risk-aversion persists, the leading cause of this rally was the weakening US dollar. Moreover, recent inflation rates have doubled central banks' comfort levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor that may have contributed to the pair&rsquo;s rise is the European Central Bank. With an interest rate hike in July now being a possibility, several government council members have declared their willingness to increase interest rates as soon as possible. In fact, according to financial analysts, the odds of a 50 bps rise at the start of the third quarter have risen from 40% to 52%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week the GBP/USD pair crossed into positive territory for the first time in over a month, allowing traders to breathe a sigh of relief. As seen in the chart above, GBP/USD started the week around the $1.23 mark, dipped and recovered to end the week near $1.25.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the UK data releases are strong, they still shed light on the massive problem the Bank of England (BoE) faces over the next few months. Based on 9% inflation data, the BoE suggests the inflation rate may even reach double digits in the coming months before dropping in late 2022/2023. On the other hand, the US dollar failed to capitalise on the Fed's hawkish comments, and US Treasury yields rose, sending GBP/USD higher to test the $1.25 level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, USD/JPY attracted some dip-buying near the &yen;127.15 level, though a modest US dollar weakness kept further gains in check. Furthermore, a generally positive tone in the equity markets also weakened the safe-haven Japanese yen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

However, it gained an upward momentum due to declining US yields and the US dollar&rsquo;s demand being impacted by the disappointing earnings figures and bleak sales prospects from large retailers in the US. For the first time since mid-April, XAU/USD recorded weekly gains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, after the announcement of zero coronavirus infections across all districts in Shanghai, the yellow metal managed to rebound and enjoy temporary relief as its price increased to reach near the $1,830 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in the chart above, gold ended its week near $1,846, swaying upwards midweek and is currently above its moving average, which acts as its support level. The 5-day SMA and 10-day SMA are around $1,844 and $1,842, respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, oil prices comfortably remained within recent ranges and aren&rsquo;t trading with much conviction. A lack of new major crude oil-relevant fundamental developments in the last week may have resulted in the WTI moving in the $105-115ish ranges. Furthermore, the proposed EU ban on Russian oil imports still hasn&rsquo;t secured the unanimous agreement amongst EU member nations that needed to go into force.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong><br /><br /></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,261.90</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-961.52</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.98%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,835.62</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-407.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.33%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,901.36</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-106.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.66%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Markets continued to face downward pressure, with Wednesday, 18 May 2022, marking the biggest one-day decline in the S&amp;P 500 index since June 2020.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022.

With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected. Additionally, Shanghai's COVID-19 lockdown actions have outweighed stable fuel demand.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/023a9e62-d04c-4222-83ad-59ca5810dfc6?width=1681&amp;height=846\" alt=\"Ethereum chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Except for Cardano (ADA), which was up by 6% in the last 7 days, all top 10 cryptocurrencies have fallen by at least 3%. Altcoins like Binance Coin (BNB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Litecoin (LTC) fell by around 6-10% for the week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market leader Bitcoin fared better than other coins, falling by only 3% in the past 7 days.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

So, traders may still be cautious since the sentiments of businesses can change very quickly.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of this week will be the highly-anticipated May update to the consumer inflation rate in the US, which could indicate whether inflation may have peaked.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></span></p>","main_image":{"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8d838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/02a23/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/476c5/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/e49a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/a7d58/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 50w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/467a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 100w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/f42d9/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 200w,\n/static/5e0ac3df359fdf81bf95f507afe82e46/1e622/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2006%20Jun%202022.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":120}}},"description":"Weekly market report â€“ 06 Jun 2022","id":"ea31c1ed-ad3b-4093-b5b9-a4908c9a2b88"}},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","blog_title":"Weekly market report â€“ 30 May 2022","slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","tags":[{"tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, markets bounced back after several weeks of decline.

As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index.

On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">EUR/USD finished the week with solid gains just below the $1.06 mark. Although risk-aversion persists, the leading cause of this rally was the weakening US dollar. Moreover, recent inflation rates have doubled central banks' comfort levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another factor that may have contributed to the pair&rsquo;s rise is the European Central Bank. With an interest rate hike in July now being a possibility, several government council members have declared their willingness to increase interest rates as soon as possible. In fact, according to financial analysts, the odds of a 50 bps rise at the start of the third quarter have risen from 40% to 52%.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This week the GBP/USD pair crossed into positive territory for the first time in over a month, allowing traders to breathe a sigh of relief. As seen in the chart above, GBP/USD started the week around the $1.23 mark, dipped and recovered to end the week near $1.25.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the UK data releases are strong, they still shed light on the massive problem the Bank of England (BoE) faces over the next few months. Based on 9% inflation data, the BoE suggests the inflation rate may even reach double digits in the coming months before dropping in late 2022/2023. On the other hand, the US dollar failed to capitalise on the Fed's hawkish comments, and US Treasury yields rose, sending GBP/USD higher to test the $1.25 level.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, USD/JPY attracted some dip-buying near the &yen;127.15 level, though a modest US dollar weakness kept further gains in check. Furthermore, a generally positive tone in the equity markets also weakened the safe-haven Japanese yen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/97e87c3d-8b0d-43b4-b32c-abdb79698a10?width=1686&amp;height=869\" alt=\"BTC/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br />Source: Bloomberg.

Click to see full size</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Due to a risk-averse market environment, gold began the week by falling below the $1,800 mark &ndash; its lowest level since late January. However, it gained an upward momentum due to declining US yields and the US dollar&rsquo;s demand being impacted by the disappointing earnings figures and bleak sales prospects from large retailers in the US. For the first time since mid-April, XAU/USD recorded weekly gains.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, after the announcement of zero coronavirus infections across all districts in Shanghai, the yellow metal managed to rebound and enjoy temporary relief as its price increased to reach near the $1,830 mark.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As seen in the chart above, gold ended its week near $1,846, swaying upwards midweek and is currently above its moving average, which acts as its support level. The 5-day SMA and 10-day SMA are around $1,844 and $1,842, respectively.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, oil prices comfortably remained within recent ranges and aren&rsquo;t trading with much conviction. A lack of new major crude oil-relevant fundamental developments in the last week may have resulted in the WTI moving in the $105-115ish ranges. Furthermore, the proposed EU ban on Russian oil imports still hasn&rsquo;t secured the unanimous agreement amongst EU member nations that needed to go into force.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong><br /><br /></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">31,261.90</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-961.52</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.98%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11,835.62</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-407.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-3.33%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3,901.36</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-106.65</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-2.66%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><br />Source: Bloomberg</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Markets continued to face downward pressure, with Wednesday, 18 May 2022, marking the biggest one-day decline in the S&amp;P 500 index since June 2020. Equity markets have continued to slip for the seventh week in a row and closed the week down by about 20% year-to-date putting it on the track to the bear-market territory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The losses were driven by concerns about inflation after a series of disappointing earnings reports from major retailers. In particular, Walmart reported lower than expected operating margins on higher input costs from freight and fuel. Traders seem to interpret these earnings as a signal that the worst is yet to come. Additionally, fears of a recession have been driven by rising inflation, supply-chain issues, and the Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates aggressively.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As traders' concerns pile up, stocks have been struggling to recover over the last 7 weeks. Alongside, traders have closely monitored any data related to retailers and consumers to determine whether inflation will slow consumer spending.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the coming week, the reports to watch out for include The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index for April, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, to be released on Friday, 27 May 2022, and earnings from Zoom, Nvidia, and Alibaba.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Terra (UST/USD) and Luna (TER/USD) are not available for trading on our platforms.</span></em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>","main_image":{"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/02a23/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 50w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/476c5/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 100w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/adee0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 200w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/e49a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/a7d58/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 50w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/467a8/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 100w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/f42d9/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 200w,\n/static/1c5bdf42db52679726152b512acced5b/1e622/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2023%20May%202022.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":120}}},"description":"Weekly Market Report â€“ 23 May 2022","id":"14379cd6-dfc7-491e-8899-25de31ee5861"}}],"videos":[{"video_title":"What is cryptocurrency?","published_date":"2022-06-02","video_description":"Learn the basics of cryptocurrency and crypto trading in our video.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Because of this weekly rise, June's deficit is now $373 billion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following its downward drop, the price of Bitcoin stabilised once again over the $20,000 mark. As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn. Furthermore, traders reduced their stakes in cryptocurrencies after the price of Bitcoin fell last week to its lowest level since 2020.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, significant US economic metrics and central bank discussions might put traders' appetites to the test.

Despite last week's Federal Reserve announcement of a 0.75% rate hike &ndash; the most significant since 1994 &ndash; Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told Congress the Fed is \"firmly committed\" to bringing inflation down.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, last week's economic data indicated that the Federal Reserve's aggressive move toward monetary tightening was having the desired effect of slowing the economy and moderating inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All 11 of the benchmark index's sectors rallied. Among them, FedEx was nearly up by 7.2%, eBay jumped by 6.3%, and Goldman Sachs Group's stock price surged by 5.8%.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Federal Reserve also said that US banks could comfortably withstand a severe economic downturn based on their capital and assets. Based on comments from Powell, interest rates are expected to go up by another 0.50% or 0.75% at the next Fed meeting in July. So, traders are watching closely and look forward to Powell's speech scheduled for later this week.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Options trading, Deriv X platform, and STP Financial accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</span></em></p>"},{"id":"90e7ee49-e150-4a31-a288-8024206a9205","main_image":{"id":"191b560e-4235-4e44-85b5-2c3a5c2d8a0e","description":"Get to know the difference between crypto exchange and crypto wallet","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/72127/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/05ada/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.jpg 320w,\n/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/4eab0/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.jpg 640w,\n/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/72127/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/8e2ef/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.webp 320w,\n/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/0cc1c/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.webp 640w,\n/static/4241c538d70d7403fad5f95620dfc6fc/7a708/Keep%20your%20coins%20safe-%20crypto%20exchange%20vs%20crypto%20wallet-2b44a79f.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"keep-your-coins-safe-crypto-exchange-vs-crypto-wallet","published_date":"2022-06-23","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"269","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}},{"id":"270","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Keep your coins safe: crypto exchange vs crypto wallet","blog_description":"Not sure where to store your crypto securely? We explore your options from crypto exchanges to crypto wallets to help you make an educated decision.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security is one of the most important aspects of crypto trading. However, if you trade crypto on Deriv, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about it at all because you don&rsquo;t buy the actual cryptocurrency. You open your trades with fiat money. Whether you trade with CFDs, options or multipliers, you only predict the price movements of an asset and get a chance to earn a payout if your prediction is correct.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you choose to </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">trade </span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">with</span></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> crypto</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> instead of fiat money, you will actually own a cryptocurrency, and that's when you need safe storage for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to&nbsp;fiat money, there are two options to keep large amounts of it safe: you either have it in cash or store it in a bank. Cryptocurrency can also be stored in 2 ways: using crypto exchanges and crypto wallets. Both are digital storage, of course, as cryptocurrencies don&rsquo;t have a physical form.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, here's an interesting note &ndash; neither crypto exchanges nor crypto wallets actually store cryptocurrency. They only provide secure access to it while the coins are stored on a blockchain. Just like when you use a credit or debit card &ndash; it&rsquo;s not actual fiat money, just a piece of plastic, but it gives you access to the money you stored in a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what's the equivalent of a card when it comes to cryptocurrency and accessing your crypto assets? It's your public and private keys.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are private and public keys in the crypto world?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public and private keys are strings of numbers, letters and other characters (similar to a password) that allow you to perform actions with your cryptocurrencies. A public key is similar to your bank account number &ndash; you can share it with other people, who can then transfer cryptocurrency to you. A private key is like your credit card PIN &ndash; not to be shared with anyone, as it gives access to your crypto.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The difference in private key management is exactly what differentiates crypto exchanges from crypto wallets.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto exchange?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency exchange is a service that allows you to buy and sell digital coins securely. An example of crypto exchanges on Deriv is </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/cashier/on-ramp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat onramp services</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &ndash; Changelly, Xanpool, or Banxa. These service providers let you exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency. The purchased crypto is deposited right into your Deriv account and can be used for trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well-known crypto exchanges, especially when they are officially affiliated with an established broker, are one of the safest options to buy, sell, and trade crypto. However, when it comes to storing large amounts, experts advise against keeping your digital coins at crypto exchanges and broker accounts for an extended period of time due to security concerns. Crypto hacks, although rarely successful, usually target exchanges as they are places where a high concentration of cryptocurrency data flows through. If that happens, you have limited control over the safety of your crypto assets and have to rely on the exchange&rsquo;s service providers entirely to keep them protected.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main reason for the limited control over your own crypto assets lies in private key access. Most cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide it &ndash; the key belongs to an exchange exclusively. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This type of storage is called custodial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to have full control over your crypto assets, a good way of keeping them safe is to transfer any crypto you don&rsquo;t use for trading to a secure crypto wallet.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is a crypto wallet?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cryptocurrency wallet is a software (programme) or hardware (device) that lets you store your digital coins safely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Software wallets are also called hot wallets and store your private keys in a programme connected to the internet. Just like almost any software nowadays, it can be accessed via a desktop app, mobile app or web browser. One of the most important features to look for when selecting a software wallet is two-factor authentication (2FA), as it strengthens security and provides ease of use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lot of hot crypto wallets are non-custodial, which means they give access to the private keys and the responsibility of its safekeeping to the owner. This type of crypto storage is usually considered much safer than custodial crypto exchanges, as long as wallets&rsquo; owners take proper care of them and backup their keys. However, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that some hot wallets are custodial too, and do not provide access to a private key.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hardware wallets, also known as cold wallets, store crypto access offline and are usually no larger than a USB flash drive. This type of wallet is considered a safer option because the device is only connected to the internet when you need to use your crypto, making it much harder to hack. The important security measure, in this case, is just keeping the device safe.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until very recently, the third type &ndash; a paper wallet, used to be considered the most secure way to protect crypto assets. A paper wallet literally means keeping your private key written or printed on a piece of paper. However, since there is a high risk of misplacing or damaging it, this type of wallet is gradually losing its popularity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both cold and paper wallet types are completely non-custodial.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing one type of crypto storage over another is purely a matter of personal preference. But do remember that it is crucial to do your research and ensure that the service provider is well-trusted and not fraudulent.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, while reviewing your options, why don't you create </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to practise your trading skills risk-free?

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively. Now, all eyes are on the UK inflation report and the Fed Chairman&rsquo;s testimony for fresh directional commands for the cable pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Bank of Japan (BoJ) governor announced that the monetary policy could be eased further if needed.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022.

Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP. So your capital can be used to increase your trade volume instead of being used for transaction fees for several trades.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar is the currency of the world&rsquo;s leading economy, and its status comes with higher liquidity. That's why many traders prefer trading major currency pairs that include this currency. However, cross-currency trading can present some unique trading opportunities that you may want to explore. Depending on which cross-currency pair you want to trade, you can trade CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X or go for options and multipliers trading on DTrader.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few cross-currency pairs you can trade on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" alt=\"Cross-currency pairs on Deriv\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why don&rsquo;t you test cross-currency pair trading first before including it in your trading strategy and portfolio?

Moreover, the ECB&rsquo;s monetary policy meeting was the main cause for the greenback&rsquo;s rally.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the above chart depicts, EUR/USD kept bouncing back and forth between the $1.0650 and $1.0750 levels for the first 4 days of the week before entering a nosedive on Friday, 10 June 2022. The pair ended the week at the $1.0519 level, which lies slightly under the SMA 10 at $1.0527 and coincides with the SMA 5 at $1.0519.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair declined for 4 consecutive days and closed the week at the $1.2316 level, which lies marginally above its SMA 5 at $1.2122. The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields. As a result, the pair came under selling pressure, which caused a drop from the long-term highs.<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The yellow metal's price went up significantly after a higher-than-expected inflation result. As seen within the chart, gold dipped below the $1,835 mark post the CPI data's release but bounced back to post a 1.64% change for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bond yields and gold are in an inverse relationship once again. With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs.

The pair&rsquo;s price increase was largely driven by government bond yields and inflation-related concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the chart above, EUR/USD is priced between the 61.8% and 50% retracement levels near $1.0730 and $1.0713, respectively. On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

On the downside, its support level is at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,846.47.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI ended the week above $118, marking a gain of over 3%.

These calculations evaluate an asset from multiple angles and can become a really powerful tool, providing valuable insights and helping you step up your trading strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are dozens of indicators you can use, but they are usually divided into groups by the type of information they provide. Some indicators may provide multiple sets of information and can therefore belong to more than one group.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ve grouped indicators into 4 main types and briefly explain how each group helps traders identify trading opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trend indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, trend refers to the direction of the price movement over an extended period of time. For example, when the price is consistently increasing, it's an uptrend, and when it's decreasing, it's a downtrend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trend indicators can help determine the direction the market will take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common trend indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average (MA)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Parabolic stop and reverse (Parabolic SAR)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; The Ichimoku Cloud</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Volume indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, volume refers to the number of trades executed within a particular time frame. It&rsquo;s a direct indication of the asset&rsquo;s supply and demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By measuring the volume of trading, volume indicators indicate whether a trend is likely to last.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, high volume on the uptrend indicates high demand and therefore, a further price increase. It works the same way in the reversed scenario: high volume on the downtrend indicates high supply and a likelihood of a further price drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common volume indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; On balance volume (OBV)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Accumulation / Distribution indicator</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Money flow index</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Volatility indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility in trading determines the degree to which a price moves over time. High volatility indicates fast and unpredictable price changes. Volatility indicators measure the price range of an asset and help to catch the moments of high volatility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders favour highly volatile assets and markets because they present numerous trading opportunities along with faster and higher gains.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common volatility indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Bolinger bands</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Donchian channel</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Average true range (ATR)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Momentum indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momentum in trading refers to the speed of the price change. Momentum indicators measure this speed, which can be helpful to see an upcoming trend change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common momentum indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Relative strength index (RSI)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Stochastic oscillator</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the best way to use technical indicators?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When traders use technical indicators, they usually apply 2-3 of them at once and compare their findings to increase the likelihood of making a correct trading decision. For example, if a trend indicator predicts the change of trend, they check the volume as well to make sure there is enough buying or selling power to support this change. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that technical indicators, just like chart patterns, are still a prediction and don&rsquo;t give 100% accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also always a good idea to test and try different combinations on your risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first before trading with real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you want to know another non-technical way of analysing financial markets, head to our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fundamental analysis</a>&nbsp;blog post and find out how major political and economic events can affect prices.</span></p>"}],"recent_eu":[{"id":"61b34dd3-a28d-4c02-897d-133f6b04ab8a","main_image":{"id":"1c61bc11-33b4-4667-afb5-c7069e9faff4","description":"Market News â€“ Week 5, June 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/72127/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/05ada/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/4eab0/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/72127/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/8e2ef/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/0cc1c/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/7a708/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-27-06-2022-03-07-2022","published_date":"2022-06-27","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"286","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Market news â€“ Week 5, June 2022","blog_description":"Last week, bulls came to the rescue of GBP/USD, rewarding the pair with its first weekly gain.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level. Since it ended the week trading at its resistance level, traders are waiting to see if this is the new support level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, which fell as low as $880 on Saturday, 18 June 2022, increased by 5.8% on Sunday, 26 June 2022, to $1,280.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the market for digital assets has experienced extreme volatility as traders dumped riskier investments due to concerns that aggressive interest rate increases could lead to an economic downturn.

On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022.

Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP. So your capital can be used to increase your trade volume instead of being used for transaction fees for several trades.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar is the currency of the world&rsquo;s leading economy, and its status comes with higher liquidity. That's why many traders prefer trading major currency pairs that include this currency. However, cross-currency trading can present some unique trading opportunities that you may want to explore. Depending on which cross-currency pair you want to trade, you can trade CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X or go for options and multipliers trading on DTrader.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few cross-currency pairs you can trade on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" alt=\"Cross-currency pairs on Deriv\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why don&rsquo;t you test cross-currency pair trading first before including it in your trading strategy and portfolio?

The pair ended the week at the $1.0519 level, which lies slightly under the SMA 10 at $1.0527 and coincides with the SMA 5 at $1.0519.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair declined for 4 consecutive days and closed the week at the $1.2316 level, which lies marginally above its SMA 5 at $1.2122. The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields. As a result, the pair came under selling pressure, which caused a drop from the long-term highs.<br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/4587f779-c82d-4968-ad98-9e0c4794b1a9?width=1682&amp;height=843\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

The yellow metal's price went up significantly after a higher-than-expected inflation result. As seen within the chart, gold dipped below the $1,835 mark post the CPI data's release but bounced back to post a 1.64% change for the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bond yields and gold are in an inverse relationship once again. With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs. This scenario resulted from US consumer prices growing faster than expected.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation fell by around 11% last week and was trading below $1,500.

So, traders may still be cautious since the sentiments of businesses can change very quickly.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The highlight of this week will be the highly-anticipated May update to the consumer inflation rate in the US, which could indicate whether inflation may have peaked.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;re up-to-date on how the financial markets performed last week, you can improve your strategy and trade CFDs on </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv MT5</strong></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Financial and Financial STP accounts.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Disclaimer:</em></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Options trading, Deriv X Platform, and STP Financial Accounts on the MT5 platform are not available for clients residing in the EU.</em></span></p>"},{"id":"3e6a9fa2-971a-411d-ba58-82e134a1bb74","main_image":{"id":"2cc186a1-a9df-41db-9797-0a61c38d4f9d","description":"Use technical indicators to refine your trading strategy on Deriv.","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a8c8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/72127/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg","srcSet":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/05ada/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 320w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/4eab0/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 640w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/72127/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/8e2ef/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 320w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/0cc1c/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 640w,\n/static/49fb239f27a67d81a2a0310472b41008/7a708/The%204%20most%20common%20types%20of%20technical%20indicators.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"the-4-most-common-types-of-technical-indicators","published_date":"2022-06-02","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"259","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"The 4 most common types of technical indicators","blog_description":"Using technical indicators is an efficient way to analyse markets and predict price movements. In this blog, we review the 4 most common groups of indicators.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is technical analysis in trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog post, you may already know that technical indicators are mathematical calculations that can help you predict the price movements of an asset. These calculations evaluate an asset from multiple angles and can become a really powerful tool, providing valuable insights and helping you step up your trading strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are dozens of indicators you can use, but they are usually divided into groups by the type of information they provide. Some indicators may provide multiple sets of information and can therefore belong to more than one group.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ve grouped indicators into 4 main types and briefly explain how each group helps traders identify trading opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trend indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, trend refers to the direction of the price movement over an extended period of time. For example, when the price is consistently increasing, it's an uptrend, and when it's decreasing, it's a downtrend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trend indicators can help determine the direction the market will take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common trend indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average (MA)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Parabolic stop and reverse (Parabolic SAR)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; The Ichimoku Cloud</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Volume indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, volume refers to the number of trades executed within a particular time frame. It&rsquo;s a direct indication of the asset&rsquo;s supply and demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By measuring the volume of trading, volume indicators indicate whether a trend is likely to last.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, high volume on the uptrend indicates high demand and therefore, a further price increase. It works the same way in the reversed scenario: high volume on the downtrend indicates high supply and a likelihood of a further price drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common volume indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; On balance volume (OBV)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Accumulation / Distribution indicator</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Money flow index</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Volatility indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility in trading determines the degree to which a price moves over time. High volatility indicates fast and unpredictable price changes. Volatility indicators measure the price range of an asset and help to catch the moments of high volatility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders favour highly volatile assets and markets because they present numerous trading opportunities along with faster and higher gains.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common volatility indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Bolinger bands</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Donchian channel</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Average true range (ATR)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Momentum indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momentum in trading refers to the speed of the price change. Momentum indicators measure this speed, which can be helpful to see an upcoming trend change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common momentum indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Relative strength index (RSI)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Stochastic oscillator</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the best way to use technical indicators?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When traders use technical indicators, they usually apply 2-3 of them at once and compare their findings to increase the likelihood of making a correct trading decision. For example, if a trend indicator predicts the change of trend, they check the volume as well to make sure there is enough buying or selling power to support this change. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that technical indicators, just like chart patterns, are still a prediction and don&rsquo;t give 100% accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also always a good idea to test and try different combinations on your risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first before trading with real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you want to know another non-technical way of analysing financial markets, head to our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fundamental analysis</a>&nbsp;blog post and find out how major political and economic events can affect prices.</span></p>"},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","main_image":{"id":"e32eaa2e-92b8-40d5-a1ce-c46ca2b7b44a","description":"Weekly Market Report â€“ 30 May 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/72127/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/05ada/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/4eab0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/72127/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/8e2ef/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/0cc1c/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/7a708/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","published_date":"2022-05-30","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"279","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report â€“ 30 May 2022","blog_description":"After several weeks of hits and dips, the financial markets finally welcomed some progress.

As we learned, a few key variables like inflation and the US dollar influenced this outcome</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Forex</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/26cf57a0-32fa-42cc-bc6e-fbd63d56c10a?width=1685&amp;height=818\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/26cf57a0-32fa-42cc-bc6e-fbd63d56c10a?width=1685&amp;height=818\" alt=\"EUR/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second week in a row, EUR/USD closed above $1.07 in a rally fueled by the broad US dollar's weakness. As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index. To add to that, the US will release the May non-farm payrolls (NFP) report.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/dddc97ea-d198-43ad-bde7-24745dbf8cb8?width=1686&amp;height=823\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/dddc97ea-d198-43ad-bde7-24745dbf8cb8?width=1686&amp;height=823\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg. Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week, gold juggled between gains and losses before completing the week with a solid comeback. On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them. Doing so will help you figure out which strategy works best for you and evaluate the potential outcomes that you'll get if you stick with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the right time to switch to a real account?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" alt=\" A woman contemplating between a demo and real account.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite answer to this question, but these signs may help you decide if it's time to use a real account:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You've found a winning strategy.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If over 50% of your positions are winning trades, this may be a sign your strategy is working. Simply put, it means your trading profits are higher than your losses. If you have defined the markets you want to trade on and are confident about your trading strategy, then it's time to put it to the test in the real-world trading environment.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Your fund management skills have improved.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that you can balance your wins and losses, it just shows that you gained a good understanding of how to manage your funds. Proper fund management will help you prevent further losses. The truth is, even the most experienced traders make mistakes with money management, and learning this skill might take you some time, but it is achievable. Once you decide to switch to a real account, ensure you have sufficient funds for a considerable time and manage it properly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You manage your emotions more effectively.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you are able to trade without giving in to your emotional reactions, you may take it as a good sign to go for a real account. Keeping your emotions in check is highly important, as they can significantly influence your decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not get too worried or panic if some of your trades don't go well. After the disappointment, take a break and let your emotions settle. Don't get too excited after a win, either. If you feel like you're on a winning streak, you may be impulsive and open additional positions. Being able to detach yourself from your trades is a crucial part of becoming a successful trader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about the benefits of having a demo account, it&rsquo;s time to get started and create your free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&rsquo;ll only take you a few minutes, and you&rsquo;ll get to practise trading risk-free using the virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to discover which traits successful traders share and how they plan out their trading strategy, check out our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Useful tips on how to trade online blog post</a> based on an ebook written by veteran trader Vince Stanzione, \"7 Traits of Successful Financial Traders.\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic and Financial STP accounts on the DMT5 platform are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>"}],"recent_uk":[{"id":"61b34dd3-a28d-4c02-897d-133f6b04ab8a","main_image":{"id":"1c61bc11-33b4-4667-afb5-c7069e9faff4","description":"Market News â€“ Week 5, June 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/72127/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/05ada/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/4eab0/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/72127/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/8e2ef/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/0cc1c/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/0868dc09fff0950b8a070e27791b6ba1/7a708/Market%20news%20%E2%80%93%20Week%205%2C%20June%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-27-06-2022-03-07-2022","published_date":"2022-06-27","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"286","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Market news â€“ Week 5, June 2022","blog_description":"Last week, bulls came to the rescue of GBP/USD, rewarding the pair with its first weekly gain.

At the start of last week, the currency pair saw an upward movement ever since it moved past the $1.0500 mark. Later, the EUR/USD pair saw a decent pullback on Thursday, 23 June 2022. However, this was short-lived as the bulls resumed their upward run, and the pair ended the week above the $1.0600 mark.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This trend change can be attributed to the weakening of the greenback over the past week. Despite the $1.0670 level acting as an upside cap to the pair, it is unlikely that the pair will break out of its slump soon. Furthermore, geopolitical concerns and the Federal Reserve-European Central Bank divergence will keep the upside in check.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the GBP/USD downtrend flattened out last week, experiencing its first weekly gains of the month. The bulls stepped in to merely stop the falling pair, which mostly traded sideways throughout the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the US dollar gaining strength, the cable pair mirrored the EUR/USD's movement with a sharp dip below $1.2200 on Thursday, 23 June 2022. Compared to the start of the week, the pair saw a marginal increase at Friday's close. As you can see from the chart, GBP/USD ended the week at $1.2272, bisecting the SMA 5 and SMA 10 at $1.2270 and $1.2274, respectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Level up your trading strategy with the latest market news and trade CFDs on your <a href=\"https://deriv.com/derivx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Deriv X</strong></a> Financial account.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Commodities</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/b4958dfe-9f8f-4f60-86ab-01c7c8520aa6?width=1679&amp;height=836\" alt=\"Gold chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

It then proceeded to find a floor due to the thinner liquidity condition brought on by the US holiday of Juneteenth. However, XAU/USD's upside remains capped, as traders seem wary of the Fed's aggressive monetary policy.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Thursday, 23 June 2022, the yellow metal extended its losing streak into the fourth straight trading day. This drop is linked to the market's reassessment of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony in the bi-annual Monetary Policy Report, where he managed to gain acceptance for his justification of the recent rate hike. However, his testimony apparently favoured the risk appetite and gold prices momentarily, resulting in an upward movement. Nevertheless, gold still ended with losses for the second consecutive week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second half of June hasn't been the best for WTI oil as it fell sharply on Wednesday, 22 June 2022. This fall resulted from US President Biden's push to bring down soaring fuel prices. The move, which includes pressure on major American energy companies to lower fuel prices as they have been reaping huge profits, calls for a temporary suspension of federal taxes on gasoline. However, WTI oil regained traction and rebounded on Friday, 24 June 2022. With OPEC (Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) member Libya closing nearly all production due to unrest, supply concerns were revived, leading to WTI oil's recovery.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/f633790d-e414-4556-a5b1-85d011ede1a6?width=1676&amp;height=824\" alt=\"Bitcoin chart on Deriv\" /></span></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Because of this weekly rise, June's deficit is now $373 billion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following its downward drop, the price of Bitcoin stabilised once again over the $20,000 mark. As seen in the chart above, Bitcoin closed the week up by 2.33% at the $21,400 level.

This further intensifies the inflationary pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) as it battles the concern of a fading Euro. On the other hand, the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">continued strengthening </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of the US dollar has caused the EUR/USD pair to close the week in the negative territory.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As seen in the chart above, after starting the week on a downtrend and falling to $1.1971, the GBP/USD pair experienced a short-term rally on Thursday, 16 June 2022, and prices reached a three-day high of around $1.2381. Furthermore, the release of disappointing US macro data </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">weakened the greenback</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and served as support to the declining GBP/USD pair.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, its slight recovery from two-year lows faltered due to the diverging monetary policy announcements by the Fed and Bank of England (BoE) towards the end of last week. As a result, the currency pair ended the week at $1.2227, slightly above the SMA 10 at $1.2220 and nearly bisecting at its SMA 5 and SMA 15 at $1.2211 and $1.2245, respectively.

On Friday, 17 June 2022, oil prices fell by 6% to a four-week low and ended the week at around $112 a barrel.

However, Bitcoin has clawed its way back to around the $20k mark on Sunday, 19 June 2022. This movement may indicate a swift turnaround after the recent successive declines since institutional traders may see a buying opportunity after Bitcoin reaches the rock-bottom level.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Ethereum, in particular, performed poorly, going down by 40% over the same period and trading at around $1,000.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In part, macroeconomic factors were to blame for the downfall of the crypto market. Recently, cryptocurrencies have not been working as an inflation-proof asset as the performance of equity and bond markets has directly impacted Bitcoin. Inflation has been rising lately, causing central banks to raise interest rates, hitting risky assets.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to the extreme market conditions, several cryptocurrency-lending companies have halted their operations in withdrawals, transfers, and swaps requests.

Can they sharpen your trading strategy? Read our blog to find out.","blog_post":"<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jim Alvarez was a forex trader who usually traded major currency pairs. In 2016, when talks of Brexit were making headlines, he decided to include cross-currency pairs in his trading strategy, which enabled him to diversify his portfolio and balance out his risk.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What are cross-currency pairs?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs, also known as currency crosses, are currency pairs which don&rsquo;t include the US dollar. In forex,&nbsp; currencies are traded against each other and the most popular are Euro, US dollar, Japanese Yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Pound sterling, Swiss franc, and the New Zealand dollar. If you exclude the US dollar from the list and trade any of these currencies against each other, you would be trading cross-currency pairs.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How did cross-currency pairs come to exist?</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After World War II, globalisation was setting in, and there was a need to understand how the currencies of different countries ranked against each other. However, this called for a standardised format by which these currencies could be measured. Post-WWII, the US economy and currency ranked among the strongest internationally, and since the US dollar at this time was also linked to gold, it became the world's reserve currency. This means it is usually held by a central bank and is used as a common denomination for international trades and included in the country's foreign exchange reserves.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When that happened, if a trader wanted to trade Pound sterling against Euro, they would have to convert Pound sterling to US dollar first and then US dollar to Euro. This created drawbacks and traders were losing out on favourable exchange rates as it took more time to place a trade.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the pace of globalisation increased and the forex market grew, traders wanted to have easy access to several currencies without relying on the US dollar. This is why cross-currency pairs were introduced &ndash; to ensure a seamless conversion of currencies that aren't linked to the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why you should consider adding cross-currency pairs to your trading portfolio</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cross-currency pairs present multiple trading opportunities, and here are 4 reasons why they can be a beneficial addition to your trading strategy:</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trade without being tied to the US dollar</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you trade currency pairs linked to the US dollar, you are limited to a single prediction of whether the US dollar might go up or down. However, with cross-currency pairs, you can consider other factors that are not affected by the US dollar and discover more trading opportunities. Trading cross-currency pairs can also be a part of your go-to trading strategy if you need to wait out volatile trading conditions with the US dollar.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Diversify your portfolio&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading different instruments helps you to keep your portfolio varied and may increase your chances of enhanced potential profit. Plus, you also have the chance to trade currency pairs, which are sensitive to price movements in the commodities market because those countries produce and export various goods and services. Keep in mind this strategy depends on thorough research of political, social, and economic factors that influence these trends.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Hedging&nbsp;</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, hedging is a strategy in which you secure your trade (if the market doesn&rsquo;t move in your favour) by also placing an opposite trade. You can spread out the risk by trading different cross-currency pairs in order to secure yourself against the volatility of cross-currency rates.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Increase your trade volume during specific world events</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, if you wanted to capitalise on a world event that wasn't tied to the US dollar, you would have to place 2 separate trades, incurring 2 transaction fees. As an example, if you wanted to trade Euro and Pound sterling you would have to pay transaction fees for a EUR/USD trade and a GBP/USD trade. However, with cross-currency pairs, you get to place a trade directly on the currency itself &ndash; EUR/GBP. So your capital can be used to increase your trade volume instead of being used for transaction fees for several trades.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The US dollar is the currency of the world&rsquo;s leading economy, and its status comes with higher liquidity. That's why many traders prefer trading major currency pairs that include this currency. However, cross-currency trading can present some unique trading opportunities that you may want to explore. Depending on which cross-currency pair you want to trade, you can trade CFDs on Deriv MT5 and Deriv X or go for options and multipliers trading on DTrader.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few cross-currency pairs you can trade on Deriv:</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/2590f575-86f7-4074-ae21-05e68c98369a?width=1278&amp;height=557\" alt=\"Cross-currency pairs on Deriv\" /></a><br /><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why don&rsquo;t you test cross-currency pair trading first before including it in your trading strategy and portfolio?

The pair ended the week at the $1.0519 level, which lies slightly under the SMA 10 at $1.0527 and coincides with the SMA 5 at $1.0519.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The GBP/USD pair declined for 4 consecutive days and closed the week at the $1.2316 level, which lies marginally above its SMA 5 at $1.2122. The pair&rsquo;s bearish stint is being reinforced by the Brexit woes and political instability in the UK. Furthermore, the receding resistance line has countered any upside movements by the cable pair since mid-April. The pair now awaits the Fed and Bank of England (BoE)&rsquo;s monetary policy decisions coming later this week for the next directional bias.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair has almost reached the &yen;135 level, hitting over two-decade highs. This price movement can be attributed to relentless dollar demand in the US due to inflation and stronger yields.

With the expectation that the Fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at least once in the next 3 meetings to combat rampant inflation, the benchmark 10-year yield is at its highest since 2018.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rising yields are heating the zero-yielding gold, which has also caused the US dollar to rise. Additionally, Fed tightening expectations have overshadowed rising recession fears while influencing the XAU/USD price. Traders are now anticipating the Fed's rate hike announcement on Wednesday, 15 June 2022 and its impact on related assets.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, oil prices dropped on Friday, 10 June 2022 but remained near three-month highs.

The pair&rsquo;s price increase was largely driven by government bond yields and inflation-related concerns.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at the chart above, EUR/USD is priced between the 61.8% and 50% retracement levels near $1.0730 and $1.0713, respectively. On the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 76.4% retracement level at around $1.0751.

There are no significant economic releases until Friday, 10 June 2022, so traders will prepare for this critical event as policymakers enter their blackout period before the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

As per the above chart, gold is priced just below the 50% retracement level at around $1,851.63. If this level is breached, its next resistance level would be at the 61.8% retracement level near $1,856.78. On the downside, its support level is at the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,846.47.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WTI ended the week above $118, marking a gain of over 3%. Additionally, the US job market grew faster than expected in July, indicating that economic growth will continue, thereby boosting crude and refined product demand.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite easing virus restrictions, oil prices have risen as demand has increased.

Traders who sold stocks reacted to the rise in interest rates with fears of the Federal Reserve tightening monetary policy at the forefront.

In this blog, we review the 4 most common groups of indicators.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/what-is-technical-analysis-in-trading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is technical analysis in trading</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog post, you may already know that technical indicators are mathematical calculations that can help you predict the price movements of an asset. These calculations evaluate an asset from multiple angles and can become a really powerful tool, providing valuable insights and helping you step up your trading strategies.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are dozens of indicators you can use, but they are usually divided into groups by the type of information they provide. Some indicators may provide multiple sets of information and can therefore belong to more than one group.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this blog, we&rsquo;ve grouped indicators into 4 main types and briefly explain how each group helps traders identify trading opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Trend indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, trend refers to the direction of the price movement over an extended period of time. For example, when the price is consistently increasing, it's an uptrend, and when it's decreasing, it's a downtrend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trend indicators can help determine the direction the market will take.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common trend indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average (MA)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Parabolic stop and reverse (Parabolic SAR)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; The Ichimoku Cloud</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Volume indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In trading, volume refers to the number of trades executed within a particular time frame. It&rsquo;s a direct indication of the asset&rsquo;s supply and demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By measuring the volume of trading, volume indicators indicate whether a trend is likely to last.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, high volume on the uptrend indicates high demand and therefore, a further price increase. It works the same way in the reversed scenario: high volume on the downtrend indicates high supply and a likelihood of a further price drop.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common volume indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; On balance volume (OBV)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Accumulation / Distribution indicator</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Money flow index</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Volatility indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Volatility in trading determines the degree to which a price moves over time. High volatility indicates fast and unpredictable price changes. Volatility indicators measure the price range of an asset and help to catch the moments of high volatility.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many traders favour highly volatile assets and markets because they present numerous trading opportunities along with faster and higher gains.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common volatility indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Bolinger bands</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Donchian channel</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Average true range (ATR)</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Momentum indicators</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Momentum in trading refers to the speed of the price change. Momentum indicators measure this speed, which can be helpful to see an upcoming trend change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common momentum indicators are:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Relative strength index (RSI)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Moving average convergence divergence (MACD)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&ndash; Stochastic oscillator</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the best way to use technical indicators?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When traders use technical indicators, they usually apply 2-3 of them at once and compare their findings to increase the likelihood of making a correct trading decision. For example, if a trend indicator predicts the change of trend, they check the volume as well to make sure there is enough buying or selling power to support this change. But it&rsquo;s important to remember that technical indicators, just like chart patterns, are still a prediction and don&rsquo;t give 100% accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&rsquo;s also always a good idea to test and try different combinations on your risk-free </span><a href=\"https://app.deriv.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo account</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first before trading with real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, if you want to know another non-technical way of analysing financial markets, head to our <a title=\"\" href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/fundamental-analysis-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fundamental analysis</a>&nbsp;blog post and find out how major political and economic events can affect prices.</span></p>"},{"id":"8f7f9ea1-cee9-42fb-97d3-241ae1b7badf","main_image":{"id":"e32eaa2e-92b8-40d5-a1ce-c46ca2b7b44a","description":"Weekly Market Report â€“ 30 May 2022","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/72127/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg","srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/05ada/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 320w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/4eab0/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 640w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/72127/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/8e2ef/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 320w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/0cc1c/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 640w,\n/static/03e7aaa06696685cbd73fda88c3a8829/7a708/Weekly%20market%20report%20%E2%80%93%2030%20May%202022.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"the-weekly-market-report-30-05-2022-05-06-2022","published_date":"2022-05-30","featured":false,"tags":[{"id":"279","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Market reports"}}],"blog_title":"Weekly market report â€“ 30 May 2022","blog_description":"After several weeks of hits and dips, the financial markets finally welcomed some progress.

Click to see full size</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the second week in a row, EUR/USD closed above $1.07 in a rally fueled by the broad US dollar's weakness. As seen in the chart above, the price stayed above the 5 and 10 SMA's (now acting as the support levels) towards the end of the week, maintaining an upward momentum.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Euro recently benefited from rising European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate expectations. Markets are now anticipating a tightening of over 100bps through the end of the year, starting with the first hike in July.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, GBP/USD extended its recovery from two-year lows of $1.2155 in the preceding week, finishing the week at around $1.2631. The widespread US dollar selling pressure fueled the rise in GBP/USD in the second half of the week. This factor led to the currency pair reaching its highest level in a month, at around $1.27.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, it is far too early to forecast if the US dollar will remain weak for much longer. However, persistent inflation is keeping the Federal Reserve (Fed) on track, allowing them to re-evaluate the effectiveness of its current policy on inflation.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week the focus will be on inflation, with the EU publishing its preliminary estimates of the May Consumer Price Index.

On the road to recovery, gold is aiming to retest its two-week highs while the US dollar struggles to gain ground as market sentiment remains mixed and Treasury yields remain low.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the dismal US GDP and the Pending Home Sales report also contributed to the slowing down of the US economy, making traders reposition themselves ahead of the minutes of the May Fed meeting. Therefore, last week's rally in global stocks also weighed down on the US dollar's safe-haven appeal, benefiting gold.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the chart for the week, gold is around the 38.2% retracement level at around $1,853. If gold continues to go down, its next support level would be at the 23.6% retracement level near $1,850. However, on the upside, its next resistance level would be at the 50% retracement level at around $1,856.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, oil prices increased by 3% on Thursday, May 26 2022 &ndash; the most in 2 weeks. This increase is due to a long bet on surging gasoline consumption ahead of the Memorial Day holiday, which marks the start of America's peak driving season on Monday (May 30 2022). The price also increased due to the European government considering whether or not to ban Russian crude oil completely.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cryptocurrencies</strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/c6a6c62d-8f66-4906-80ce-787c0b555fea?width=1685&amp;height=819\" alt=\"ETH/USD chart on Deriv\" /></a><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg.

Bitcoin currently holds 45.25% of the crypto asset market and has seen an overall price increase of 0.04% in the last seven days.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During this period, ETH's price dropped by around 10%. This dip is visible in the chart above, along with a sharp drop on Thursday, 26 May 2022, and then it continued to trade sideways for the rest of the week.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, Altcoins too underperformed over the weekend. Last week, the price of SOL (Solana) dropped by 10.54%, while the price of ADA (Cardano) dropped by 4.78%.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Terra's new blockchain was launched over the weekend. With this new development, the old token would become Luna Classic (LUNC), while the new token would be Luna 2.0 (LUNA). The elaborate proposal involved airdropping new tokens to LUNA and UST tokens holders before the crash. Unfortunately, in the wake of the UST de-pegging debacle, traders appear sceptical about LUNA Classic and LUNA 2.0.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximise market opportunities by sharpening your trading strategy and trading the financial markets with options and multipliers on <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>DTrader</strong></a>.</span></p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>US Indices</strong></h2>\n<table style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Name of the index</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday&rsquo;s close</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*Net Change (%)</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dow Jones Industrial (Wall Street 30)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">33,212.96</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,332.72</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.18%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nasdaq (US Tech 100)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12,681.42</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">647.14</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.38%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">S&amp;P 500 (US 500)</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4,158.24</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">184.49</span></p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; vertical-align: middle; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.64%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Source: Bloomberg </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br /></span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">*</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net change and net change % are based on the weekly closing price change from Monday to Friday.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street saw its first positive week in nearly 2 months. All 3 major US indexes were in the green as they ended a losing streak that some feared was a prelude to a recession. The Dow climbed by 4.18%, the S&amp;P 500 gained 4.64%, and the Nasdaq gained 5.38%.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US markets have mostly had a lousy year as soaring inflation, rising interest rates, the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus pandemic rattled traders and weighed on corporate profits. Until Friday's close, the Dow had fallen for eight consecutive weeks, while the broader S&amp;P 500 index and Nasdaq had declined for seven straight weeks.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This jump occurred because the yield on benchmark US Treasuries fell after data showed that US consumer spending rose in April and the uptick in inflation slowed. Both factors are signs that the world's largest economy could be on track to grow this quarter.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming week, key updates in the labour market are expected, with the release of Jobs Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) openings, hires, and separations, ADP private payrolls, and the official May non-farm payrolls report.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them. Doing so will help you figure out which strategy works best for you and evaluate the potential outcomes that you'll get if you stick with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the right time to switch to a real account?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" alt=\" A woman contemplating between a demo and real account.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite answer to this question, but these signs may help you decide if it's time to use a real account:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You've found a winning strategy.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If over 50% of your positions are winning trades, this may be a sign your strategy is working.

Find more about this ongoing competition in our blog.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking services are an essential part of our lives. We get paid, pay the bills, and swipe our bank cards at grocery stores all the time. In one way or another, almost every financial operation we do goes through a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite its vital necessity, the banking industry is confronted with some fierce competition. The emerging non-traditional banking trend is slowly taking over the market, and many believe it to be more aligned with evolving consumer needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The take-off point of the competition</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crisis of 2008 was one of the worst economic disasters for the entire world. Once the dust settled, it didn&rsquo;t take long to find out that the market collapse was triggered by incompetent actions by the banks.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the entire financial industry derailed, banks began actively investing in hedge funds, using their clients&rsquo; money. To raise more funds for this financial activity, they started signing off too many mortgages without conducting background checks. When the borrowers stopped paying, the artificially-created housing bubble burst, wrecking the entire industry along the way. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millions of people were affected, including those with no mortgages at all.&nbsp; Banks used their savings for investing with a high risk of no return and weren&rsquo;t able to cover the deficit without the cash injection from the homeowners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was never a secret that when you keep your money in the bank, as a long-term deposit, for example, your resources are being used to fund other financial operations. However, when the crisis struck, it became apparent that there were no limitations or solid policy behind such utilisation. Consumer&rsquo;s trust in bank services was broken. People were in need of safer solutions to manage their finances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s when non-traditional banking started growing rapidly to fill the void. A little more than a decade later, temporary bank closures, caused by the worldwide pandemic and global lockdowns, served as a fertiliser to an already gaining popularity trend.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what are these non-traditional banks?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we are presented with a wide range of alternatives to the good old traditional bank account. Real estate trust funds, fintech companies, or neobanks that operate solely online without any physical location are just some non-traditional banks examples. Even well-known tech giants like Google and Amazon provide money transfer services that exclude traditional banks entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new institutions offer lower fees, faster services, full transparency of transactions, extra services and a more wholesome customer service approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite growing popularity, it&rsquo;s still questionable whether non-traditional banks are here to replace traditional banking. After all, the majority of alternative banks are still tied to regular banks due to licensing regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, it looks like traditional banking is not going to give up easily.&nbsp;With the strong competition breathing down their necks, banks have no other choice but to refine their services. Interactive and user-friendly mobile apps, a growing number of extra services, and increasing accessibility reveal the determination to keep up with the evolving demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who is leading in this race? In a modern, ever-changing world, it&rsquo;s quite hard to identify the winner or even predict the outcome of this confrontation. But we certainly need to be ready to embrace any possible scenario. And that&rsquo;s our strategy at Deriv.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does Deriv keep up with the non-traditional banking trend?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international fintech companies like us, it&rsquo;s too early to talk about discarding traditional banking entirely. That&rsquo;s why we are focused on blending both traditional and non-traditional services to provide our clients with alternatives according to their preferences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, we offer multiple deposit and withdrawal options that include both traditional and non-traditional banking &ndash; regular bank transfers, digital or crypto wallets, and peer-to-peer solutions. Our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-easy-guide-on-how-to-buy-crypto-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat to crypto exchange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the latest trends Deriv has embraced to bridge the two worlds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of services our client chooses, we keep their money completely segregated from company funds to ensure its safety. Clients are free to track the movement of their funds and to withdraw them whenever they want because they aren&rsquo;t merged with the company&rsquo;s funds or used for business interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also strive to be as accessible and supportive to our clients as possible to make sure they are always up to date and have access to high-quality modern solutions. That&rsquo;s why we are continuously working on introducing new platforms, mobile apps, products, and services to deliver a reliable and seamless on-the-go experience. And our customer support is available round the clock to help with technical difficulties or general questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So whether non-traditional banks will take over the industry eventually or some new trend will emerge in the nearest future, we&rsquo;ve got your back.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat to crypto exchange and peer-to-peer solutions are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"9d7c2ef3-7095-4b81-8d70-1ecb46e58fbe","main_image":{"id":"aec386bc-8cc1-40c3-8886-76dac19028b4","description":"Cryptocurrency trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#880888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/72127/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/05ada/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 320w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/4eab0/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 640w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/72127/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/8e2ef/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 320w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/0cc1c/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 640w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/7a708/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"get-on-the-cryptocurrency-action","published_date":"2022-05-12","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"191","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}}],"blog_title":"Why do you need to get in on the cryptocurrency action?","blog_description":"Wondering why the entire world is going crazy about cryptocurrencies?

It's hard to miss the headlines about it, whether you already own crypto or have never considered having it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many people still prefer using good old fiat currency &mdash; paper money issued by a government. Are you missing out on something important if you don&rsquo;t have crypto?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While fiat currency is not going anywhere anytime soon, cryptocurrency can be a good investment in the future. Let&rsquo;s explore why.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of using crypto</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of the cryptocurrency world is its decentralisation. It means that virtual money is not issued and not controlled by any government, which makes digital coins completely independent. Cryptocurrencies are immune to inflation, bank failures and monetary policies of the governments. Aside from this, there are a number of other advantages of using these decentralised currencies:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Value</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to inflation, fiat currencies lose their value and buying power over time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global yearly inflation rate can be anywhere from 1% to 10% and higher, depending on the economic situation. So, 100 USD deposited into your fiat account will have a lower value a year later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, cryptocurrency is a highly volatile market with big price fluctuations. It means if you invest the same 100 USD in it, its value can either increase or decrease over time. However, the value of the majority of digital coins has increased significantly over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, people who bought one Bitcoin in 2011 with 1 USD and kept it until today have thousands of dollars in value for the same digital coin at the moment of writing. Although it experienced a few upward and downward price swings, it has never dropped back to 1 USD, multiplying the value of the initial investment thousands of times.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Security</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the cryptocurrency world has witnessed some hacking attacks, they were targeting crypto wallets, while the virtual currencies and technology behind them are still highly secure and cannot be hacked. There is no way to make a fake cryptocurrency or steal your identity to use the digital coins you own. Nobody can show up at the bank with a weapon and demand giving them all the crypto it has.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency transactions are also irreversible, which adds an extra level of security. Unlike regular debit and credit card transactions, which face fraud activities frequently nowadays, cryptocurrency is not exposed to this risk. Once a transaction is completed and digital coins are transferred to a new account, they cannot be recalled unless the recipient decides to transfer them back.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Convenience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat currencies are limited to the borders of the countries using them. For example, the USD is accepted worldwide, but in many countries, you still need to change it to a local currency to be able to use your money. Cryptocurrencies have similar prices everywhere, regardless of the country and continent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, cryptocurrency transactions are very fast, and the majority of them are still considered inexpensive. You don&rsquo;t have to wait 3-4 business days and pay a high fee to receive the transferred amount like you normally do with regular bank transfers. You can also transfer a tiny fraction of cryptocurrency, up to the 100th million part of it, unlike fiat transfers that require a minimum amount.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know why crypto is such a hot topic and why you need to get in on the crypto action, head on to the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading with crypto: Top 3 myths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog.

Minimum stake as low as 0.35 USD</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The minimum stake varies depending on the market and asset and ranges from 0.35 USD to 1 USD. This gives beginners </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an opportunity to start trading and learn concepts in a practical and cost-effective</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way. Even if you start with low capital, you can still explore different trade types, markets, and strategies.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Contract duration as short as 1 second</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader is one of the very few platforms that allows you to place trades for durations as short as 1 second. In other words, if you are confident about how the market will move in just a few seconds, DTrader allows you to make a quick entry and exit. Besides that, DTrader offers you an opportunity to place multiple trades on different markets, and with different trade types simultaneously to potentially profit from small price fluctuations.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Risk management features</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk management is an essential part of trading, and that applies even when you are trading without purchasing the asset. On DTrader, you can view your stake and payout correlation before placing the trade. This feature gives you a clear idea of how much you'll earn if your prediction turns out to be correct, or how much you have to pay for a certain level of profit. Plus, multipliers include risk management features such as </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take profit, stop loss, and deal cancellation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing you to manage risks even more effectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a glance, the DTrader platform has a well-spaced layout with a designated spot for every tool, allowing easy navigation.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them. Doing so will help you figure out which strategy works best for you and evaluate the potential outcomes that you'll get if you stick with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the right time to switch to a real account?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" alt=\" A woman contemplating between a demo and real account.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite answer to this question, but these signs may help you decide if it's time to use a real account:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You've found a winning strategy.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If over 50% of your positions are winning trades, this may be a sign your strategy is working. Simply put, it means your trading profits are higher than your losses. If you have defined the markets you want to trade on and are confident about your trading strategy, then it's time to put it to the test in the real-world trading environment.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Your fund management skills have improved.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that you can balance your wins and losses, it just shows that you gained a good understanding of how to manage your funds. Proper fund management will help you prevent further losses. The truth is, even the most experienced traders make mistakes with money management, and learning this skill might take you some time, but it is achievable. Once you decide to switch to a real account, ensure you have sufficient funds for a considerable time and manage it properly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You manage your emotions more effectively.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you are able to trade without giving in to your emotional reactions, you may take it as a good sign to go for a real account. Keeping your emotions in check is highly important, as they can significantly influence your decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not get too worried or panic if some of your trades don't go well. After the disappointment, take a break and let your emotions settle. Don't get too excited after a win, either. If you feel like you're on a winning streak, you may be impulsive and open additional positions. Being able to detach yourself from your trades is a crucial part of becoming a successful trader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about the benefits of having a demo account, it&rsquo;s time to get started and create your free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It&rsquo;ll only take you a few minutes, and you&rsquo;ll get to practise trading risk-free using the virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to discover which traits successful traders share and how they plan out their trading strategy, check out our <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/useful-tips-on-how-to-trade-online\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Useful tips on how to trade online blog post</a> based on an ebook written by veteran trader Vince Stanzione, \"7 Traits of Successful Financial Traders.\"</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthetic and Financial STP accounts on the DMT5 platform are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deal cancellation feature is not available on multipliers on cryptocurrencies for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>"},{"id":"f6e5e745-9ee2-4141-8054-587a396be709","main_image":{"id":"b2e39fc6-40cb-446a-9741-a9f2bb75c378","description":null,"imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#786868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/72127/Non-traditional%20banking.jpg","srcSet":"/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/05ada/Non-traditional%20banking.jpg 320w,\n/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/4eab0/Non-traditional%20banking.jpg 640w,\n/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/72127/Non-traditional%20banking.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/8e2ef/Non-traditional%20banking.webp 320w,\n/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/0cc1c/Non-traditional%20banking.webp 640w,\n/static/0ec7e61512e262d2cc760b010909d298/7a708/Non-traditional%20banking.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"non-traditional-banking-the-tesla-of-financial-industry","published_date":"2022-05-19","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"168","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Strategies and tips"}}],"blog_title":"Non-traditional banking: why itâ€™s the Tesla of the financial industry","blog_description":"Does the new non-traditional banking trend impose a threat to brick and mortar banks? Find more about this ongoing competition in our blog.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking services are an essential part of our lives. We get paid, pay the bills, and swipe our bank cards at grocery stores all the time. In one way or another, almost every financial operation we do goes through a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite its vital necessity, the banking industry is confronted with some fierce competition. The emerging non-traditional banking trend is slowly taking over the market, and many believe it to be more aligned with evolving consumer needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The take-off point of the competition</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crisis of 2008 was one of the worst economic disasters for the entire world. Once the dust settled, it didn&rsquo;t take long to find out that the market collapse was triggered by incompetent actions by the banks.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the entire financial industry derailed, banks began actively investing in hedge funds, using their clients&rsquo; money. To raise more funds for this financial activity, they started signing off too many mortgages without conducting background checks. When the borrowers stopped paying, the artificially-created housing bubble burst, wrecking the entire industry along the way. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millions of people were affected, including those with no mortgages at all.&nbsp; Banks used their savings for investing with a high risk of no return and weren&rsquo;t able to cover the deficit without the cash injection from the homeowners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was never a secret that when you keep your money in the bank, as a long-term deposit, for example, your resources are being used to fund other financial operations. However, when the crisis struck, it became apparent that there were no limitations or solid policy behind such utilisation. Consumer&rsquo;s trust in bank services was broken. People were in need of safer solutions to manage their finances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s when non-traditional banking started growing rapidly to fill the void. A little more than a decade later, temporary bank closures, caused by the worldwide pandemic and global lockdowns, served as a fertiliser to an already gaining popularity trend.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what are these non-traditional banks?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we are presented with a wide range of alternatives to the good old traditional bank account. Real estate trust funds, fintech companies, or neobanks that operate solely online without any physical location are just some non-traditional banks examples. Even well-known tech giants like Google and Amazon provide money transfer services that exclude traditional banks entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new institutions offer lower fees, faster services, full transparency of transactions, extra services and a more wholesome customer service approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite growing popularity, it&rsquo;s still questionable whether non-traditional banks are here to replace traditional banking. After all, the majority of alternative banks are still tied to regular banks due to licensing regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, it looks like traditional banking is not going to give up easily.&nbsp;With the strong competition breathing down their necks, banks have no other choice but to refine their services. Interactive and user-friendly mobile apps, a growing number of extra services, and increasing accessibility reveal the determination to keep up with the evolving demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who is leading in this race? In a modern, ever-changing world, it&rsquo;s quite hard to identify the winner or even predict the outcome of this confrontation. But we certainly need to be ready to embrace any possible scenario. And that&rsquo;s our strategy at Deriv.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does Deriv keep up with the non-traditional banking trend?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international fintech companies like us, it&rsquo;s too early to talk about discarding traditional banking entirely. That&rsquo;s why we are focused on blending both traditional and non-traditional services to provide our clients with alternatives according to their preferences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, we offer multiple deposit and withdrawal options that include both traditional and non-traditional banking &ndash; regular bank transfers, digital or crypto wallets, and peer-to-peer solutions. Our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-easy-guide-on-how-to-buy-crypto-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat to crypto exchange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the latest trends Deriv has embraced to bridge the two worlds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of services our client chooses, we keep their money completely segregated from company funds to ensure its safety. Clients are free to track the movement of their funds and to withdraw them whenever they want because they aren&rsquo;t merged with the company&rsquo;s funds or used for business interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also strive to be as accessible and supportive to our clients as possible to make sure they are always up to date and have access to high-quality modern solutions. That&rsquo;s why we are continuously working on introducing new platforms, mobile apps, products, and services to deliver a reliable and seamless on-the-go experience. And our customer support is available round the clock to help with technical difficulties or general questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So whether non-traditional banks will take over the industry eventually or some new trend will emerge in the nearest future, we&rsquo;ve got your back.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat to crypto exchange and peer-to-peer solutions are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"9d7c2ef3-7095-4b81-8d70-1ecb46e58fbe","main_image":{"id":"aec386bc-8cc1-40c3-8886-76dac19028b4","description":"Cryptocurrency trading on Deriv","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#880888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/72127/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/05ada/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 320w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/4eab0/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 640w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/72127/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/8e2ef/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 320w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/0cc1c/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 640w,\n/static/9e97620f04ec8435cde41d33ece03a2b/7a708/Why%20do%20you%20need%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20cryptocurrency%20action--dae16f2b.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"get-on-the-cryptocurrency-action","published_date":"2022-05-12","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"191","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}}],"blog_title":"Why do you need to get in on the cryptocurrency action?","blog_description":"Wondering why the entire world is going crazy about cryptocurrencies? Here are the main benefits of using crypto that will make you want to have it too","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people are familiar with cryptocurrencies to some extent today. It's hard to miss the headlines about it, whether you already own crypto or have never considered having it.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many people still prefer using good old fiat currency &mdash; paper money issued by a government. Are you missing out on something important if you don&rsquo;t have crypto?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While fiat currency is not going anywhere anytime soon, cryptocurrency can be a good investment in the future. Let&rsquo;s explore why.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benefits of using crypto</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest advantage of the cryptocurrency world is its decentralisation. It means that virtual money is not issued and not controlled by any government, which makes digital coins completely independent. Cryptocurrencies are immune to inflation, bank failures and monetary policies of the governments. Aside from this, there are a number of other advantages of using these decentralised currencies:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Value</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to inflation, fiat currencies lose their value and buying power over time. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The global yearly inflation rate can be anywhere from 1% to 10% and higher, depending on the economic situation. So, 100 USD deposited into your fiat account will have a lower value a year later.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, cryptocurrency is a highly volatile market with big price fluctuations. It means if you invest the same 100 USD in it, its value can either increase or decrease over time. However, the value of the majority of digital coins has increased significantly over time.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, people who bought one Bitcoin in 2011 with 1 USD and kept it until today have thousands of dollars in value for the same digital coin at the moment of writing. Although it experienced a few upward and downward price swings, it has never dropped back to 1 USD, multiplying the value of the initial investment thousands of times.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Security</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although the cryptocurrency world has witnessed some hacking attacks, they were targeting crypto wallets, while the virtual currencies and technology behind them are still highly secure and cannot be hacked. There is no way to make a fake cryptocurrency or steal your identity to use the digital coins you own. Nobody can show up at the bank with a weapon and demand giving them all the crypto it has.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cryptocurrency transactions are also irreversible, which adds an extra level of security. Unlike regular debit and credit card transactions, which face fraud activities frequently nowadays, cryptocurrency is not exposed to this risk. Once a transaction is completed and digital coins are transferred to a new account, they cannot be recalled unless the recipient decides to transfer them back.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Convenience</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat currencies are limited to the borders of the countries using them. For example, the USD is accepted worldwide, but in many countries, you still need to change it to a local currency to be able to use your money. Cryptocurrencies have similar prices everywhere, regardless of the country and continent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, cryptocurrency transactions are very fast, and the majority of them are still considered inexpensive. You don&rsquo;t have to wait 3-4 business days and pay a high fee to receive the transferred amount like you normally do with regular bank transfers. You can also transfer a tiny fraction of cryptocurrency, up to the 100th million part of it, unlike fiat transfers that require a minimum amount.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know why crypto is such a hot topic and why you need to get in on the crypto action, head on to the </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/trading-with-crypto-top-3-myths\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trading with crypto: Top 3 myths</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog.

Minimum stake as low as 0.35 USD</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The minimum stake varies depending on the market and asset and ranges from 0.35 USD to 1 USD. This gives beginners </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an opportunity to start trading and learn concepts in a practical and cost-effective</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way. Even if you start with low capital, you can still explore different trade types, markets, and strategies.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Contract duration as short as 1 second</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader is one of the very few platforms that allows you to place trades for durations as short as 1 second. In other words, if you are confident about how the market will move in just a few seconds, DTrader allows you to make a quick entry and exit. Besides that, DTrader offers you an opportunity to place multiple trades on different markets, and with different trade types simultaneously to potentially profit from small price fluctuations.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Risk management features</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk management is an essential part of trading, and that applies even when you are trading without purchasing the asset. On DTrader, you can view your stake and payout correlation before placing the trade. This feature gives you a clear idea of how much you'll earn if your prediction turns out to be correct, or how much you have to pay for a certain level of profit. Plus, multipliers include risk management features such as </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take profit, stop loss, and deal cancellation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing you to manage risks even more effectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a glance, the DTrader platform has a well-spaced layout with a designated spot for every tool, allowing easy navigation.

There are so many trading terms to learn, a wide range of markets and products to understand, and, of course, one needs to find a trading strategy that will work for them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account can help you work through the basics in a risk free environment. It allows you to familiarise yourself with different trading platforms and enables you to practise trading skills and strategies using virtual funds.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can create a demo account on all of Deriv&rsquo;s trading platforms. You can get started with&nbsp; 10,000 USD virtual money, which you can top up any time you run out. You&rsquo;ll be able to open positions on your preferred trading platform to get a good grasp of how it works and explore the available assets to trade.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A demo account can also help you with the other aspects of trading, including:</span></p>\n<h2><strong>The importance of risk management</strong></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some people go into financial trading with a &ldquo;get it all at once&rdquo; mindset. After a few wins, they go all-in with their capital, hoping to make a fortune in one transaction, which eventually results in more losses than expected.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you can practise your trades however you want since it&rsquo;s risk-free. You can go all in all at once if you wish to without worrying about losing money, allowing you to build a strategy on how you can trade carefully and manage risks appropriately.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you&rsquo;d like to explore your risk management skills, creating a demo account on Deriv&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dtrader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DTrader</a> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platform is a great way to do so. With DTrader, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you get to trade with multipliers on forex, synthetic indices, and cryptocurrency.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Multipliers has features</a> such as stop loss, take profit, and deal cancellation. These features allow you to customise your trades based on your risk appetite and trade strategies.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>In-depth market analysis</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several financial markets on which you can trade on Deriv </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&mdash; forex, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stocks and stock indices</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and synthetic indices. These markets have different characteristics, given the various elements, such as world events, that could affect them. That's why it's crucial to study the market movements with the help of market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a demo account, you get the opportunity to analyse how each of these markets work, not only to widen your knowledge about each market but also to understand past trades' outcomes better. Plus, you won't risk losing real money.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the demo account, you&rsquo;ll get a good sense of how the market works on real live trading platforms; the only difference is you don&rsquo;t need to spend real funds. It comes equipped with features and tools that trading platforms have, including indicators, real-time quotes, charting tools, journals, news feeds, and more. As you practise trading while analysing the market movements more closely, the more likely you&rsquo;ll be able to make smarter trading decisions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A great example of an online trading platform with all these features is <a href=\"https://deriv.com/dmt5/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv MT5</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where you can set up a demo account under your preferred account type &mdash; Synthetics, Financial, and Financial STP &mdash; and start practising how to execute and monitor your trades.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Synthetics account, you can trade CFDs on Deriv&rsquo;s proprietary synthetic indices 24/7, which simulate real-world market movements.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Financial account, you can trade major and minor currency pairs, commodities, cryptocurrencies, stocks, &amp; indices with leverage.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whereas with a Financial STP account, you get to trade major, minor, and exotic currency pairs and cryptocurrencies with tight spreads and higher trade volumes.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Developing a plan</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An online trading demo account also helps you to understand the importance of planning out your trades. For instance, if you've already created or learned some strategies, your demo account allows you to practise and fine-tune them. Doing so will help you figure out which strategy works best for you and evaluate the potential outcomes that you'll get if you stick with it.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When is the right time to switch to a real account?</span></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img src=\"https://deriv-academy.directus.app/assets/978e8b23-bfbf-4531-a606-40bd0d7fe77d\" alt=\" A woman contemplating between a demo and real account.\" width=\"1280\" height=\"768\" /></span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no definite answer to this question, but these signs may help you decide if it's time to use a real account:</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You've found a winning strategy.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If over 50% of your positions are winning trades, this may be a sign your strategy is working. Simply put, it means your trading profits are higher than your losses. If you have defined the markets you want to trade on and are confident about your trading strategy, then it's time to put it to the test in the real-world trading environment.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Your fund management skills have improved.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find that you can balance your wins and losses, it just shows that you gained a good understanding of how to manage your funds. Proper fund management will help you prevent further losses. The truth is, even the most experienced traders make mistakes with money management, and learning this skill might take you some time, but it is achievable. Once you decide to switch to a real account, ensure you have sufficient funds for a considerable time and manage it properly.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>You manage your emotions more effectively.</strong></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you are able to trade without giving in to your emotional reactions, you may take it as a good sign to go for a real account. Keeping your emotions in check is highly important, as they can significantly influence your decision-making.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not get too worried or panic if some of your trades don't go well. After the disappointment, take a break and let your emotions settle. Don't get too excited after a win, either. If you feel like you're on a winning streak, you may be impulsive and open additional positions. Being able to detach yourself from your trades is a crucial part of becoming a successful trader.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you&rsquo;ve learned about the benefits of having a demo account, it&rsquo;s time to get started and create your free <a href=\"https://deriv.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Deriv demo account</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Find more about this ongoing competition in our blog.","blog_post":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking services are an essential part of our lives. We get paid, pay the bills, and swipe our bank cards at grocery stores all the time. In one way or another, almost every financial operation we do goes through a bank.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, despite its vital necessity, the banking industry is confronted with some fierce competition. The emerging non-traditional banking trend is slowly taking over the market, and many believe it to be more aligned with evolving consumer needs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The take-off point of the competition</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The crisis of 2008 was one of the worst economic disasters for the entire world. Once the dust settled, it didn&rsquo;t take long to find out that the market collapse was triggered by incompetent actions by the banks.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the entire financial industry derailed, banks began actively investing in hedge funds, using their clients&rsquo; money. To raise more funds for this financial activity, they started signing off too many mortgages without conducting background checks. When the borrowers stopped paying, the artificially-created housing bubble burst, wrecking the entire industry along the way. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Millions of people were affected, including those with no mortgages at all.&nbsp; Banks used their savings for investing with a high risk of no return and weren&rsquo;t able to cover the deficit without the cash injection from the homeowners.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was never a secret that when you keep your money in the bank, as a long-term deposit, for example, your resources are being used to fund other financial operations. However, when the crisis struck, it became apparent that there were no limitations or solid policy behind such utilisation. Consumer&rsquo;s trust in bank services was broken. People were in need of safer solutions to manage their finances.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That&rsquo;s when non-traditional banking started growing rapidly to fill the void. A little more than a decade later, temporary bank closures, caused by the worldwide pandemic and global lockdowns, served as a fertiliser to an already gaining popularity trend.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what are these non-traditional banks?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we are presented with a wide range of alternatives to the good old traditional bank account. Real estate trust funds, fintech companies, or neobanks that operate solely online without any physical location are just some non-traditional banks examples. Even well-known tech giants like Google and Amazon provide money transfer services that exclude traditional banks entirely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These new institutions offer lower fees, faster services, full transparency of transactions, extra services and a more wholesome customer service approach.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But despite growing popularity, it&rsquo;s still questionable whether non-traditional banks are here to replace traditional banking. After all, the majority of alternative banks are still tied to regular banks due to licensing regulations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plus, it looks like traditional banking is not going to give up easily.&nbsp;With the strong competition breathing down their necks, banks have no other choice but to refine their services. Interactive and user-friendly mobile apps, a growing number of extra services, and increasing accessibility reveal the determination to keep up with the evolving demand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So who is leading in this race? In a modern, ever-changing world, it&rsquo;s quite hard to identify the winner or even predict the outcome of this confrontation. But we certainly need to be ready to embrace any possible scenario. And that&rsquo;s our strategy at Deriv.</span></p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does Deriv keep up with the non-traditional banking trend?</span></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For international fintech companies like us, it&rsquo;s too early to talk about discarding traditional banking entirely. That&rsquo;s why we are focused on blending both traditional and non-traditional services to provide our clients with alternatives according to their preferences.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, we offer multiple deposit and withdrawal options that include both traditional and non-traditional banking &ndash; regular bank transfers, digital or crypto wallets, and peer-to-peer solutions. Our </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/an-easy-guide-on-how-to-buy-crypto-on-deriv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fiat to crypto exchange</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is one of the latest trends Deriv has embraced to bridge the two worlds.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regardless of services our client chooses, we keep their money completely segregated from company funds to ensure its safety. Clients are free to track the movement of their funds and to withdraw them whenever they want because they aren&rsquo;t merged with the company&rsquo;s funds or used for business interest.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also strive to be as accessible and supportive to our clients as possible to make sure they are always up to date and have access to high-quality modern solutions. That&rsquo;s why we are continuously working on introducing new platforms, mobile apps, products, and services to deliver a reliable and seamless on-the-go experience. And our customer support is available round the clock to help with technical difficulties or general questions.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So whether non-traditional banks will take over the industry eventually or some new trend will emerge in the nearest future, we&rsquo;ve got your back.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disclaimer:</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiat to crypto exchange and peer-to-peer solutions are not available for clients residing within the EU.</span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This content is not intended for clients residing in the UK.</span></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"id":"d3cc1c2c-c749-4be0-84e9-9c085b975932","main_image":{"id":"783fd8e8-f1f0-42ee-8c00-84b38acd6bfa","description":"An Introduction to Dtrader the Trading Platform","imageFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/72127/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/05ada/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.jpg 320w,\n/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/4eab0/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.jpg 640w,\n/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/72127/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/8e2ef/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.webp 320w,\n/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/0cc1c/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.webp 640w,\n/static/1d9e65c41963aa338f7bc32798ccbc38/7a708/An%20introduction%20to%20Dtrader%20the%20trading%20platform.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":768}}}},"slug":"an-introduction-to-dtrader-the-trading-platform","published_date":"2022-05-05","featured":true,"tags":[{"id":"251","tags_id":{"tag_name":"DTrader"}},{"id":"252","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Cryptocurrencies"}},{"id":"253","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Forex"}},{"id":"254","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Synthetic indices"}},{"id":"255","tags_id":{"tag_name":"Stocks & stock indices"}}],"blog_title":"An introduction to DTrader the trading platform","blog_description":"DTrader is a powerful and easy-to-use trading platform.

Minimum stake as low as 0.35 USD</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The minimum stake varies depending on the market and asset and ranges from 0.35 USD to 1 USD. This gives beginners </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an opportunity to start trading and learn concepts in a practical and cost-effective</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way. Even if you start with low capital, you can still explore different trade types, markets, and strategies.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Contract duration as short as 1 second</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DTrader is one of the very few platforms that allows you to place trades for durations as short as 1 second. In other words, if you are confident about how the market will move in just a few seconds, DTrader allows you to make a quick entry and exit. Besides that, DTrader offers you an opportunity to place multiple trades on different markets, and with different trade types simultaneously to potentially profit from small price fluctuations.</span></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Risk management features</span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risk management is an essential part of trading, and that applies even when you are trading without purchasing the asset. On DTrader, you can view your stake and payout correlation before placing the trade. This feature gives you a clear idea of how much you'll earn if your prediction turns out to be correct, or how much you have to pay for a certain level of profit. Plus, multipliers include risk management features such as </span><a href=\"https://deriv.com/academy/blog/posts/risk-management-features-on-deriv-multipliers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">take profit, stop loss, and deal cancellation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, allowing you to manage risks even more effectively.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a glance, the DTrader platform has a well-spaced layout with a designated spot for every tool, allowing easy navigation.
